# this_folder3 = Path(__file__).parent

# This will fail:

# this works:

# create a new folder:
# Path("/my/directory").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# find path to your running code
# project_root = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1] # this is the folder 2 levels up from your running code.

# create a new PathObj:
# static_files = project_root / 'static' # if you like this sort of thing they overrode the divide operator.
# media_files = Path(project_root, 'media') # I prefer this method.

# how to define 2 sub-directories at once:
# compiled_js_folder = static_files.joinpath('dist', 'js') # this is robust across all OS.

# gather items from specified path
# list(static_files.iterdir()) # returns a list of all items in directory.
# [x for x in static_files.iterdir if x.is_dir()] # list of only directories in a folder.
# [x for x in static_files.iterdir if x.is_file()] # same for files only.

# get a list of items matching a pattern:
# files = list(compiled_js_folder.glob('*.js')) # returns files ending with '.js'.

# sort the list of files by timestamp:
# files.sort(key=lambda fn: fn.stat().st_atime)
# atime, mtime, ctime don't seem to mean what I think. (Pathlib error?)

# search recursively down your folders path:
# sorted(project_root.rglob('*.js'))
